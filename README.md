## ***Important Note***

***The default audio queue is `apples` and the default motion is a `flick` of the device.***

## Setup

> Ensure you have both Node.js and npm installed on your machine. Then at the root of the repository, run:

```
npm install
ionic serve
```

## Deployment

> Ensure you are in the root directory of your repo, and that you have ran npm install recently. Then, simply run the following commands.

```
npm run build
npm run deploy
```

## Notes

- For the gestures, if you are looking for more reliable results, we recommend using either `FLICK` or `TRIANGLE`.
